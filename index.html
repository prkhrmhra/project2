  <h2>üíå Scrolling Love Letter ‚Äì From 5 September to Forever</h2>
  <p class="quote">This is more than a letter.<br>This is a living timeline of our journey ‚Äî from a quiet September evening to a forever that‚Äôs just beginning.</p>

  <p class="highlight">It all began on 5 September 2023 at 5:30 PM.</p>
  <p>A simple meeting ‚Äî one moment in time, but little did I know‚Ä¶ you would become the center of my world.</p>

  <p class="highlight">We spoke for the first time on 6 September at 11:30 AM.</p>
  <p>From that day forward, my heart began keeping a quiet record of every moment, every feeling, every smile.</p>

  <p>Then came October. Distance, silence, breaks. But in that space, something grew. A soft spark ‚Äî a feeling I didn‚Äôt understand yet‚Ä¶ but couldn‚Äôt ignore.</p>

  <p class="highlight">By 22 December, I finally understood: I wasn‚Äôt just fond of you ‚Äî I was in love with you.</p>

  <p>But love ‚Äî real love ‚Äî often comes with a storm of patience. January to March felt like holding back a tidal wave. Every day I smiled and spoke to you, while my heart screamed, quietly, ‚ÄúTell her‚Ä¶ just tell her.‚Äù</p>

  <p class="highlight">Then came 1 April 2024.</p>
  <p>I finally did. I told you how I felt. And it wasn‚Äôt a joke. It was the most honest confession of my life.</p>
  <p>You didn‚Äôt answer immediately. And that silence? I respected it. Because love waits, too.</p>

  <p class="highlight">And then‚Ä¶ on 26 June 2024, you chose me. You promised me.</p>
  <p>And that moment is etched in my soul.</p>

  <p>But love isn‚Äôt a perfect movie. We had our distances. We cried. We misunderstood. You saw the parts of me that I hadn't yet faced.</p>
  <p>You noticed every tiny detail. I missed some of them. Not because I didn‚Äôt care‚Äî but because I was still learning how to love you the way you deserve.</p>
  <p>I hurt you, sometimes unknowingly. But you never stopped believing in me.</p>

  <p class="highlight">After the vacation, I picked you up at the airport with a flower.</p>
  <p>You returning to me ‚Äî felt like everything realigned.</p>
  <p>We started living life together: College classes, evening walks to DLF, Infocity, even KIIT Square. Snacks, arguments, laughter ‚Äî us.</p>

  <p class="highlight">1 September ‚Äî you gave me a white rose.</p>
  <p>Delicate, thoughtful, meaningful. Like you.</p>

  <p class="highlight">1 November ‚Äî our first college fest.</p>
  <p>You wore that white kurti with jhumkas‚Ä¶ ufff. I was completely lost in you.</p>

  <p class="highlight">9 November ‚Äî you forgave me.</p>
  <p>Again. Stronger.</p>

  <p class="highlight">24 November ‚Äî that pink top. That ponytail.</p>
  <p>I fell. Again. Like the first time never happened.</p>

  <p class="highlight">1 December ‚Äî Jaydev Vartika trip.</p>
  <p>Just us, just friends, but so much more.</p>

  <p class="highlight">7 December ‚Äî cultural night. One-piece dress.</p>
  <p>My heart didn‚Äôt stand a chance.</p>

  <p class="highlight">23 December ‚Äî my black jacket. Your open hair.</p>
  <p>You looked divine.</p>

  <p class="highlight">1 January 2025 ‚Äî we told the world.</p>
  <p>And my official proposal. It was no longer a secret. It was us, out loud.</p>

  <p class="highlight">1 February ‚Äî you changed your travel plans for me.</p>
  <p>So I could attend my seminar. Selfless, beautiful love.</p>

  <p class="highlight">2 February ‚Äî Puri trip.</p>
  <p>Waves. Smiles. Love.</p>

  <p class="highlight">14 February ‚Äî our first real date. Movie: Chhava.</p>
  <p>But my eyes were only on you.</p>

  <p class="highlight">16 February ‚Äî your gift: that bag.</p>

  <p class="highlight">1 March ‚Äî the red one-piece.</p>
  <p>You were stunning.</p>

  <p class="highlight">22 March ‚Äî shopping together.</p>
  <p>Small things, shared joy.</p>

  <p class="highlight">28 March ‚Äî the saree.</p>
  <p>You weren‚Äôt just beautiful. You were breathtaking.</p>

  <p class="highlight">5 April ‚Äî mehendi with my name hidden.</p>
  <p>You wrote me into your skin.</p>

  <p>We made Ghibli art together after that ‚Äî like creating little windows into our love story.</p>

  <p>Yes, we‚Äôve fought. Yes, we‚Äôve repeated mistakes. But we‚Äôve also repeated forgiveness. We‚Äôve chosen each other ‚Äî again and again.</p>

  <p class="highlight">You chose the same internship ‚Äî just to be close.</p>
  <p>Not online. Not on calls. But beside me.</p>

  <p class="highlight">14 June 2025 ‚Äî Zaika Palace.</p>
  <p>You were there. Smiling. Holding my hand. A dream fulfilled.</p>

  <p class="highlight">‚ù§ So here we are. One year.</p>
  <p>A year of beginnings, breakdowns, growth, and countless breathtaking moments.</p>

  <p class="highlight">Thank you</p>
  <p>For loving me through my flaws. For holding me even when I pushed away. For being you.</p>

  <p class="highlight">This is our first anniversary ‚Äî but only the first of many.</p>

  <p class="highlight">üíç I love you.</p>
  <p>More than words. More than mistakes. More than time itself.</p>

  <p>Forever yours. Growing. Healing. Loving. Just for you.</p>

  <p class="highlight">üåπ Happy Anniversary, my love.</p>
